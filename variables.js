Day 1 Challenges:
-------------------------------------------- */

// Example
let message = "Hello World!";
console.log(message);

/* --------------------------------------------

Challenge 1:
Imagine it's the first day of class. (Wait, it is the first day isn't it..Deja vu?)
Everyone's participating in an icebreaker and has to introduce themselves.
It goes something like:

-------------------------------------------- */

console.log("------------------- Challenge 1 -------------------")


console.log(`Hi! My name is ${Tina}`);
console.log(`I'm in the ${10}th grade.`);
console.log(`A fun fact about me is that ${I like swimming}`);


// **** Challenge 1: Problem 1 ****
// Declare and initalize the variables with your response for the three statements above!
// Hint: Also think about where you would declare and initialize those variables


// **** Upchallenge! ****
// Can you also print out the data type of the variables?




// **** Challenge 1: Problem 2 ****
// Create a string for the different lines of the Happy Birthday Song
// Print out the song using the stings you declared.
"Happy birthday to you"
"Happy birthday to you"
"Happy birthday dear (name)"
"Happy birthday to you"


// **** Challenge 1: Problem 3 ****
// Print out a string that has backticks in it.
`Hello`



/* --------------------------------------------

Challenge 2:
Below is a set of problems to help you solidify your understanding of math operators
Write your solution code under each commented problem.

-------------------------------------------- */

console.log("------------------- Challenge 2 -------------------")

// Here are some variables to get you started
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 10;

// **** Challenge 2: Problem 1 ****
// Store the sum of num1 and num2 in a variable.
// Print the sum.
let message = 15;

// **** Challenge 2: Problem 2 ****
// Store the difference between sum (above) and 7 in a variable.
// Print the difference.
let message = 8;


// **** Challenge 2: Problem 3 ****
// Store the product of the difference and 3 in a variable.
// Print the product.
let message = 24;

// **** Challenge 2: Problem 4 ****
// Store the power of the product squared in a variable.
// Print the power.
let message = 576;

// **** Challenge 2: Problem 5 ****
// Store the quotient of the power divided by 4 in a variable.
// Print the quotient.
let message = 144;

// **** Challenge 2: Problem 6 ****
// Store the remainder of the quotient divided by 2 in a variable.
// Print the remainder.
let message = 72;

// **** Upchallenge! ****
// Given a variable that stores a number, print the values that come right before and right after.
// For example, given the number 4, the program should print 3 and 5.
// Your code should work if the value of the variable is changed.

let num = 9;
